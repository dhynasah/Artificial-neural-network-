# Artificial-neural-network-
This code uses python to create a neural network that can distinguish handwritten digits.  Training data is fed through the network. The network uses the data to learn to recognize the  digits, and then applies that to the testing data. This network uses sigmoid as the activation  fiction and cross entropy for the cost calculation.
